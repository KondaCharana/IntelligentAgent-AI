# IntelligentAgent-AI
In AI, an agent refers to any entity that perceives its environment through sensors and acts upon that environment through effectors. Essentially, it's an autonomous entity capable of making decisions and taking actions to achieve its goals.

Let's break down this definition with an example:

Imagine a self-driving car navigating through city streets. In this scenario:

Environment: The streets, traffic signals, other vehicles, pedestrians, weather conditions, etc. form the environment.
Sensors: The self-driving car has sensors such as cameras, lidar, radar, and GPS, which it uses to perceive its surroundings. These sensors provide data about the state of the environment, including the positions of other vehicles, pedestrians, traffic signals, road signs, etc.
Agent: The self-driving car itself is the agent. It processes the data from its sensors, makes decisions based on that data (e.g., whether to accelerate, brake, turn left or right), and sends commands to its effectors.
Effectors: The effectors of the self-driving car include the steering wheel, accelerator, brakes, and turn signals. These effectors enable the car to take actions in the environment based on the decisions made by its AI algorithms.
So, in this example, the self-driving car acts as an agent by perceiving its environment through sensors and taking actions to navigate safely to its destination.

**To Design an agent :**
Performance | Environment | Action | Sensors | must be included

**Goal of an Agents**
High Performance | Optimized Result | Rational Action(to achive correct& best outcome)
